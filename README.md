•	How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Use industry best standards, comment the code, make it modular and concise. Each element of CRUD was spaced out and commented so it was easy to identify. When I needed to troubleshoot actually implementing the code, it was very user friendly to come back into the code and make adjustments. These principles of CRUD are the foundation to interfacing with any database so the skills are valuable.

•	How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Using the requirements that were gathered by the client was the guiding stone of the entire project. It even helped to understand their mission to ensure that the code was usable and user friendly. My code can make it possible to help people! This was my first experience with full stack, so I really see the importance of consistency and clean data.

•	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientist enable users to achieve their goals and their missions.  They take countless points of data; store it and display it in meaningful ways to give the data worth. Sometimes working with data it’s self evident when factors are missing. You can suggest that to the client to help them understand their data. An example would a geographic region has a heavy population of a certain breed, therefore they will need more of that kind of trainer for that area. Data unlocks many helpful observations.
